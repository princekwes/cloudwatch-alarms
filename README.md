What is AWS CloudWatch?

AWS CloudWatch is a powerful monitoring and observability service provided by Amazon Web Services. It enables you to gain insights into the performance, health, and operational aspects of your AWS resources and applications. CloudWatch collects and tracks metrics, collects and monitors log files, and sets alarms to alert you on certain conditions.

  Automated Actions: With CloudWatch Alarms, you can set up automated actions like triggering an Auto Scaling group to scale in or out based on certain conditions.
  Log Insights: CloudWatch Insights lets you analyze and search log data from various AWS services, making it easier to troubleshoot problems and identify trends.
  Dashboards and Visualization: Create custom dashboards to visualize your application and infrastructure metrics in one place, making it easier to understand the overall 
  health of your system.

Now lets go to your terminal and create the file that will spike the CPU for us to get alerts.

In your terminal, with ssh into the ec2 instance done, use vim to create a file called "cpuspike.py" and you can give it any name but make sure the .py extension added.

Open the "cpu_spike.py" in the repo and copy the code into the file you just created::
Save and exit.

Run Python3 cpuspike.py and head to the cloudwatch to see the alarm show a red sign that its traggered.
